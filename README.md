# Introduction
- This is an implementation of [Mozilla's Hello Webxr example](https://mixedreality.mozilla.org/hello-webxr/) in React, React Three Fiber ([@react-three/fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)) and React XR ([@react-three/xr](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-xr))
- This is still a WIP, so PRs are welcomed

# Getting Started
- After checking out, run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Once installation completes, in the project directory, you can run:
`npm start`
- You should be able to see some scenes similar to [Mozilla's Hello Webxr example](https://mixedreality.mozilla.org/hello-webxr/), but implemented with React and React Three Fiber
